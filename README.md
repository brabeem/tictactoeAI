# tictactoe_minimax_AI
An AI that plays tic tac toe using Minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning.
[minimax algorithm and alpha beta pruning]https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-4-alpha-beta-pruning/

It uses a search tree where before taking any move a player makes sure to take a move take maximizes the score and which in turn minimizes the score of the opponent.

This algorithm have achieved an AI tictactoe that is unbeatable by human.
